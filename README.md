# MeshCommander in Docker

Run [MeshCommander](http://www.meshcommander.com/meshcommander) inside Docker to provide a simple way to get access to Intel
AMT out-of-band management on Linux. MeshCommander is accessible on port 3000,
which is exposed by the container.

This repository is [vga101/meshcommander](https://hub.docker.com/r/vga101/meshcommander/), but set up to update automatically with dependabot, so it should always have an updated version of meshcommander
